# Automated File Organizer in Python with GUI
Automatic Files Organizer.
An automated file organizer categorizes files by their extensions and groups them by type. The software scans and moves files from a user-specified source path to a user-defined destination path (it doesn't copy the files; it moves them). Using the file extension, it determines the file type and organizes it alongside other files of the same type within the specified destination path.

# Problem
Review the backups conducted over the years, spanning from the past to the present, in order to declutter both external and internal hard drives as well as NAS. Establish an organized system for easy archiving of the accumulated contents in the future. This involves managing numerous disorganized folders, subfolders, and files of varying sizes. Additionally, considering the extensive duration of these backups, there may be numerous duplicate files, obsolete files generated by software that are still accessible, and intricate nested structures that pose challenges in navigation. Plus, manually reviewing and organizing all your backups takes too much time and effort.

# Solution
I require software that allows me to specify a source path and a destination path. The software should meticulously analyze all folders, subfolders, and files within the source path. It will then examine their extensions and cross-reference them with a pre-configured dictionary of extensions. The software will organize and transfer the files to the designated destination path, grouping them by type based on their extensions. Consequently, after the scanning process, the source path will be nearly empty, while the destination path will be structured into subfolders corresponding to file types, each containing all files of a specific type (e.g., images, videos, word documents, presentations, PDFs, etc.). I also want to monitor all the operations carried out by the software, therefore, I need to specify a log file path. The software will automatically generate a log file containing comprehensive information each time it executes a scan.
